# ENHEP
Statistics and machine learning tutorials for ENHEP school in Egypt.

## Introduction
The jupyter notebooks in this package depend on a few well-known Python packages:

| __modules__   | __description__     |
| :---          | :---        |
| pandas        | data table manipulation, often with data loaded from csv files |
| numpy         | array manipulation and numerical analysis      |
| scipy         | scientific computing    |
| matplotlib    | a widely used plotting module for producing high quality plots |
| pylab         | embedded within matplotlib and provides Matlab-like features |
| scikit-learn  | easy to use machine learning toolkit |
| sympy         | an excellent symbolic algebra module |

This package can be installed as follows:
```
git clone https://github.com/hbprosper/ENHEP
```

A few of the statistics notebooks depend on ROOT (e.g., 6.14/06)
